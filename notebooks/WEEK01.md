##学习内容:  

什么是ML?
>"ML is the field of study that gives computers the ability without being explicity programmed."  
简单来说就是放入素材交给计算机训练, 让计算机自己输出正确的答案而不需要人为的写非常精确的代码.

机器学习有多个算法:   
- supervised learning
- unspervised learning
- recommentder systems
- reinforcement learning

Supervised Learning  
regression: predict a number from infinitly many possible numbers.  
classification: predict cateegories or classes, like determining whether an animal in a image is a cat or dog, 
or whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The final prediction may not be a number, but a category.

Unsupervised Learning (super supervised learning)  
从给的无标签数据中找到一些共性. 在没有正确答案的情况下找到某一个输入的特点.  
Data only comes with input X, but not output Y. Algorithm has to find structure in data.  
Cluster: group similar data or points together. like related news under the news you have seen, 
或者可以通过许多人的DNA自主判断出某一段是对应什么性状.  
Anomaly detection: find unusual events.  
Diamensionality reduction: Take a big data set, and almost magically compress it to much smaller data set, 
while losing as little information as possible.
