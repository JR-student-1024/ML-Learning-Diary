    "- **regression**: predict a number from infinitly many possible numbers.  \n",
    "- **classification**: predict cateegories or classes, like determining whether an animal in a image is a cat or dog, \n",
    "or whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The final prediction may not be a number, but a category.\n",

    "### Unsupervised Learning (super supervised learning)  \n",
    "从给的无标签数据中找到一些共性. 在没有正确答案的情况下找到某一个输入的特点.  \n",
    "Data only comes with input X, but not output Y. Algorithm has to find structure in data.  \n",

    "- **Cluster:** group similar data or points together. like related news under the news you have seen, \n",
    "alternatively, it is possible to autonomously determine which trait a DNA segment corresponds to by analyzing the DNA of many people.\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: find unusual events.  \n",
    "- **Diamensionality reduction**: Take a big data set, and almost magically compress it to much smaller data set, while losing as little information as possible."
